## 2022 BenchCouncil International Symposium On Benchmarking, Measuring And Optimizing (Bench22)
** Bench22 CFP: https://www.benchcouncil.org/bench22/cfp.html**

** Sponsored and organized by the International Open Benchmark Council (BenchCouncil), the Bench conference encompasses a wide range of topics in benchmarking, measurement, evaluation methods and tools. Bench’s multi-disciplinary emphasis provides an ideal environment for developers and researchers from the architecture, system, algorithm, and application communities to discuss practical and theoretical work covering workload characterization, benchmarks and tools, evaluation, measurement and optimization, and dataset generation. Bench’22 conference invites manuscripts describing original work in the area of benchmarking, evaluation methods and tools in Big Data, Artifical Intelligence, High-Performance Computing and Computing Architectures. All accepted papers will be presented at the Bench’22 conference, and will be published by Springer LNCS (Indexed by EI). Distinguished papers will be recommended to and published by the BenchCouncil Transactions on Benchmarks, Standards and Evaluation (TBench).**

## Award 
### BenchCouncil Achievement Award ($3,000)
--- This award recognizes a senior member who has made long-term contributions to benchmarking, measuring, and optimizing. The winner is eligible for the status of a BenchCouncil Fellow. 

### BenchCouncil Rising Star Award ($1,000)
--- This award recognizes a junior member who demonstrates outstanding potential for research and practice in benchmarking, measuring, and optimizing.

### BenchCouncil Best Paper Award ($1,000)
--- This award recognizes a paper presented at the Bench conferences, which demonstrates potential impact on research and practice in benchmarking, measuring, and optimizing.
 
### BenchCouncil Distinguished Doctoral Dissertation Award ($2000)
--- This award recognizes and encourages superior research and writing by doctoral candidates in the broad field of benchmarks, data, standards, evaluations, and optimizations community. This year, the award includes two tracks, including the BenchCouncil Distinguished Doctoral Dissertation Award in Computer Architecture ($1000) and BenchCouncil Distinguished Doctoral Dissertation Award in other areas ($1000). Among the submissions of each track, four candidates will be selected as finalists. They will be invited to give a 30-minute presentation at the Bench’22 Conference and contribute research articles to BenchCouncil Transactions on Benchmarks, Standards and Evaluation. Finally, one among the four will receive the award for each track, which carries a $1,000 honorarium.

## Bench'22 Submission
Bench'22 Submission Site: https://bench2022.hotcrp.com/

Papers must be submitted in PDF. For a full paper, the page limit is 15 pages in the LNCS format, not including references. For a short paper, the page limit is 8 pages in the LNCS format, not including references. The submissions will be judged based on the merit of the ideas rather than the length. After the conference, the proceeding will be published by Springer LNCS (Indexed by EI). Please note that the LNCS format is the final one for publishing. Distinguished papers will be recommended to and published by the BenchCouncil Transactions on Benchmarks, Standards and Evaluation (TBench).

At least one author must pre-register for the symposium, and at least one author must attend the symposium to present the paper. Papers for which no author is pre-registered will be removed from the proceedings.
